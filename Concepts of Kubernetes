yum update -y

kubectl :::
   It will interface the user and kubernetes.
kubectl [command] [type] [name] [config name]
The kubernetes objects can be created using kubectl adhoc commands(not reusable)/ using Manifest file(reusable) ex: *.yaml file.


Pods :::
   (Application programming interface)
   api version: v1 -->pods
   api version: Group_Name/version_number
   kind:

Controller Objects :::
   Replicasets
   Replication controllers
   Daemonsets
   Deployments



Volumes ::: gives persistence to the pods.
   emptyDir:: Default volume. Temporary space, if the pod gets deleted, the volume gets deleted.
   config-Map:: act as input to the pod
   secret:: act as input to the pod
   Host path::
      create a volume in a pod and create a volume in the pod-created respective worker node, and configure both in order to save the pod data wisely.
      This is on the host machine level. and smaller-scale industry
For large-scale industry
   1. Admin registers storage classes
   2. developer creates a claim
   3. After approving the claim developer will use the storage.
   persistent:: a piece of storage in the cluster.    provisioning--->Binding----> Using-----> Reclaiming. (SSD-fast, HDD-slow, glusterFS-Distributed NFS, OBJECT - Storage types)
      provisioning types:
         Static(pv needs to be created before pvc)
         Dynamic(pv is created at the same time as pvc)
   persistent volume claim:: Request for storage from application owners to storage admins in order to allocate the volume for the application.
Services:::
   Nodeport- 30000-32767********
   service port- it should be the same as the pod port.
   Targetport- pod port.
   pod ---> Active Container 
            Passive Container
Load balancer:::
   basically routes the users to the pods with the loadbalancer service and nodeport service. when the pods are exposed and replicated on different working nodes.
