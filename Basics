Kubernetes:
 > Kubernetes Orchestrates the containers on multiple host servers. 
 > It will control and automates the deployments and updates.
 > It can scale up or down the containerized applications and it's resources
 > Direct management of servers, which guarantees the running applications are the same as the desired 
   applications.
 
A Kubernetes cluster basically consists of a control panel and computing machine:
1. Control panel
   > API(Application Program Interface) Server
   > Controller: It is responsible for the control process. Where the desired number of replicas is
                 the same as that of the created count and the desired nodes are equal to the 
                 currently working nodes.
   > Scheduler: It is an intelligent block. When API Server receives a request for pod creation, the 
                schedular will quickly fetch the node information and schedules the pod creation
                according to the node's availability. 
   > etcd: It is a key-value storage of the cluster data. It helps the scheduler and controller with the 
           availability of resources and cluster state changes.
2. Compute machine
   > kubelet: It is a node agent which communicates with the master node and executes the tasks taken from
              the API Server, if there is any issue while creating a pod it will restart the creation of
              the pod and if there is an issue with the worker node, then API Server will detect the issue
              and will shift container creation to another worker node.
   > Kubeproxy: It is the core networking component inside the Kubernetes cluster it maintains the entire
                network configuration. Manages the network routing for TCP and UDP packets and allows the
                users to connect servers through the network.
   > Container run time
   > container registry
   
 Docker is a container creation tool. Whereas Kubernetes is also a
 container creation tool along with that it will allocate them on different virtual machines which is not
 possible with docker. Kubernetes controls the cluster in the form of Master and Worker nodes. There will
 be only one unique master node.
