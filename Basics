A Kubernetes cluster basically consists of a controll panel and compute machine:
1. Controll panel
   > API(Application Program Interface) Server
   > Controller
   > scheduler
   > etcd
2. Compute machine
   > kubelet
   > kubeproxy
   > continer run time
   > container registry
   
 Docker is a container creation tool. Where as Kubernetes is also a
 container creation tool along with that it will allocate them on different virtual machines which is not
 possible with docker. Kubernetes controlls the cluster in the form of Master and Worker nodes. There will
 be only one unique master node.
