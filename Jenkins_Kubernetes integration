We need 5 servers to operate the jenkins CI/CD Pipeline


1. Jenkins master (java, git, Jenkins)
2. Jenkins slave (java, git, maven, docker)
3. Kubernetes Master
4. Kubernetes workernode_1
5. Kubernetes workernode_2




Jenkins slave configuration :::
       sudo -i --> become a root user.
    1. sudo apt update -y
    2. sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre -y
    3. java -version
    4. Go to the Jenkins install and run the respective ubuntu commands that are given in the website
    5. sudo apt install git -y
    6. sudo apt install maven -y
    7. mvn --version
    8. apt get install docker.io
    6. Create a user and user access keys (devopsadmin)-----> in order to integrate the slave with master.
       sshkeys==>
          private & public authorized keys.

          1. useradd devopsadmin -s /bin/bash -m -d /home/devopsadmin  ----> creating user devopsadmin and making a directory in the user
          2. su -devopsadmin ---> login to the user space.
          3. cd /home/devopsadmin/
          4. ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m PEM  ---> it will generate a file with .ssh extension
          5. cd .ssh
          6. ls
          7. ll ---> we will see the ID's. now we have authorize those keys 
          8. cat id_rsa.pub > authorized_keys 
          9. chown -R devopsadmin /home/devopsadmin/.ssh
             chmod 600 /home/devopsadmin/.ssh/authorized_keys
             chmod 700 /home/devopsadmin/.ssh
   7. Get into the jenkins> Dashboard>manage Jenkins >node
            directory :: /home/devopsadmin
            launch method: via SSH
            Host: slave service private IP address
            credentials :: add : 1. click on jenkins
                                 2. kind : click on ssh username with private key
                                 3. ID can be anything
                                 4. username : devopsadmin
                                 5. Click on enter directly
                                 6. go to slave machine terminal cd /home/devopsadmin/.ssh
                                    ls
                                    cat id_rsa ---> opens the private key, copy it
                                 7. Host key verification strategy: select manually trusted key verification strategy.
                                 8. save it and go to the nodes, open the created node --> trust ssh host key > press yes.
Integration is done.

** Now go back to the jenkins and create any build activity with selecting an option(Restrict where this project can be run) to be the name of the slave machine.
Jenkins slave devopsadmin user can not access some of the tools that are in root level. for example be a devopsadmin user and type docker ps, you wont get anything.
In order to provide the access, we should follow the below steps. 
1. Be a root user
2. sudo usermod -aG docker devopsadmin
3. su - devopsadmin
4.
